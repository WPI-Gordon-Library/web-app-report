\section{Objective and Constraints}
    \paragraph{}
        Our objective as an IQP team was to develop a mobile application for the Gordon Library so that the individuals who use the library's numerous resources would be granted access to these resources in a more efficient and convenient manner. To achieve this goal, we were required to start from the ground up. In our initial phase of pre-development and research in this project, we were challenged with the task of programming conjointly in a live environment. Unfortunately, in order for us to program together and in a live environment,we would have needed one or more paid subscriptions to various development software that were not necessarily cheap. However, since we had little to no access to extra funding, our development was slowed down somewhat. Additionally, not all the members of our group had the necessary knowledge to be able to fully develop a mobile application from tart to finish. Thus, we needed to research, learn, and practice several pieces of software such as: IntelliJ, Vaadin, Overleaf, Jira, Confluence, Etc. Residing in a career field that is ever changing, we were able to overcome these obstacles and collaborate as a well oiled machine to develop the best product we were capable of.
