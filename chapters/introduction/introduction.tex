The WPI George C. Gordon Library offers high quality information resources, expert consultations, and a variety of meeting work spaces to support the WPI community. Before this project, the library offered its various services through in-person attendance and a responsive website. The problem was that its services offered exist on a handful of different platforms. In a world where convenience is key, this project aimed to produce a mobile-first web application with the library's services offered in one place.
